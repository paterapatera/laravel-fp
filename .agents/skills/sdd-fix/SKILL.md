# sdd-fix

Docs directory: `docs`. Issue directory: `docs/issues/<current-branch>/`. Stop when `task.md` is missing. Run setup check first. Execute only the `Fix:` majors you add. Leave other unchecked majors for `/sdd-impl`.

## Level

Judge by whether the expected behavior is already written.

| Level | Meaning | Documents | Confirmation |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | Implementation disagrees with correct documents | `task.md` only | none |
| L1 | Requirements are right and the design is wrong | research when needed, design, task | required |
| L2 | Requirements are wrong | requirements, research when needed, design, task | required |
| L3 | What Changes, Out of Scope, or Impact changes | proposal through task | required |

For L1 and above, show one plan covering the level, each document, and the reason. The user accepts, edits, or cancels that whole plan once. Then edit from upstream to downstream using the same rules as the skill that created each document. A new interface or data change raises the level to requirements. Ask at most 5 questions at a time, and ask the next 5 after the answers arrive; rounds have no limit. Each question decides one thing, and each option states only the result that differs. Put background in one or two chat sentences before the questions, not in them. Keep a question near 30 characters and an option near 15 in ja, or near 12 and 6 words otherwise, not counting its score. Prefix each option with a score from 1 to 5, as in `[5] ...`, where 5 is best. The score weighs safety most, then closeness to the ideal form, then low implementation effort. List options from the highest score. The score is the recommendation, so add no separate recommended label. Delete rewritten `base:` lines, then run `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs stamp --issue <feature>` and `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs check --issue <feature>`.

Do not uncheck finished majors. Put the changed ids, including MODIFIED and REMOVED, on the new `Fix:` minor items. Append a **top-level** `- [ ] N. Fix: ...` major (or a nested `N.M. Fix:` minor under that major when the fix is part of the same event). At close, `- Lessons:` dispositions apply only to **top-level** `N. Fix:` majors; nested minors do not need their own line. Implement the fix, check the task when tests pass. Retry a failing test twice, then stop.

For an issue created by `/sdd-quick`, L0 can be fixed in place. L1 and above stop and propose `/sdd-req`, `/sdd-design`, and `/sdd-task`.

Commit L0 once with the proposal type. For L1 and above, commit the documents as `docs`, then commit the implementation with the proposal type. Stage named files only.

## Issue feedback (`feedback.md`)

Append to `docs/issues/<current-branch>/feedback.md` (create with `# Feedback` if missing). One entry per event: `## YYYY-MM-DD sdd-fix — <kind>` then a short summary. Commit `feedback.md` on the branch when you append.

Record when:

- Each applied fix (in addition to the `Fix:` item in `task.md`): kind `applied-fix`.
- The person reports a problem found during Manual verification: kind `manual-verification`.
- The same `check` diagnostic code appears again on this issue: kind `repeat-check` (include the code and how many times seen).
