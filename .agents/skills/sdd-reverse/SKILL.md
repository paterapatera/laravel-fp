# sdd-reverse

Docs directory: `docs/sdd`. Write bodies in `ja`. Issue directory: `docs/sdd/issues/<current-branch>/`.

Run setup check first. Stop unless `proposal.md` has `Type: docs` and requirements, research, design, and task are absent. Stay on the issue branch. Cover at most one domain.

Write `requirements.md` with ADDED requirements, New domain, and New capability only, plus the Purpose and Scope sections a new spec needs. Do not change behavior. Record the code evidence as `path:line` under Context Current behavior. Ask at most 5 questions at a time when the code does not show whether something is a defect or a requirement, and ask the next 5 after the answers arrive; rounds have no limit. Each question decides one thing, and each option states only the result that differs. Put background in one or two chat sentences before the questions, not in them. Keep a question near 30 characters and an option near 15 in ja, or near 12 and 6 words otherwise, not counting its score. Prefix each option with a score from 1 to 5, as in `[5] ...`, where 5 is best. The score weighs safety most, then closeness to the ideal form, then low implementation effort. List options from the highest score. The score is the recommendation, so add no separate recommended label. Record questions, their options, and answers under Open Questions the same way as `/sdd-req`, and leave unanswered items there.

Run `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs stamp --issue <feature>` and `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs check --issue <feature>`. Commit only this issue directory as `docs`. Close later with `/sdd-close`. A docs-only issue may close without design or task, and check rejects any delta operation other than additions. `/sdd-close` stops while an Open Question remains.
