# Steering example

Each block below is one file in `docs/knowledge/steering/`, and together they pass `check` once `/specs/billing/` exists. Copy the frontmatter, heading order, glossary term level, and link form. Write the bodies in `ja` from the code, and replace every product fact.

# Architecture

## Overview

One Node.js service with a relational database.

## Quality Priorities

1. Correct invoices
2. Availability during business hours

## Context View

Customers use the web front end. The service calls the payment provider.

## Component View

- `src/orders` takes orders.
- `src/invoice` issues invoices.

## Runtime View

Confirming an order issues its invoice in the same transaction.

## Deployment View

One container per environment, deployed from CI.

## Cross-cutting Concerns

- Every request is logged with a request id.

# Tech

## Stack

- Node.js services
- PostgreSQL

## Development Environment

Node.js 22 and Docker Compose.

## Common Commands

- `npm test` runs the tests.
- `npm run dev` starts the service.

## Coding Conventions

ES modules, and one exported function per use case.

## Testing Approach

Unit tests beside the code, integration tests in `test/`.

# Structure

## Repository Layout

- `src/` holds one directory per module.
- `test/` holds integration tests.

## Module Boundaries

A module calls another module only through its exported functions.

## Naming Conventions

Files use kebab-case.

## Dependency Rules

`src/invoice` may import `src/orders`, not the reverse.

## Code-to-Specs Mapping

- `src/invoice` implements [Billing](/specs/billing/).
