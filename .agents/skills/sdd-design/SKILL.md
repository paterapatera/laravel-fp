# sdd-design

Docs directory: `docs/sdd`. Write bodies in `ja`. Issue directory: `docs/sdd/issues/<current-branch>/`. Stop when it is missing.

Run `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs check --scope setup` first. Stop when `requirements.md` has an open `- [ ] Q` item, and tell the user to finish `/sdd-req`.

## research.md

Write Questions (`RQn`), Findings, Options (`Dn`), Conclusions, and `# Delta`. Every finding bullet needs a source: `path:line`, an id, a URL with an access date, or a command plus its result. ADR candidates are decisions that are expensive to reverse, that affect more than one capability, or that change specs or steering. Ask the user to choose those, at most 5 questions at a time, and recommend one option. Decide the other points yourself. Each conclusion is `Dn: <choice> -> ADR-NEW-<k>` or `-> No ADR (<reason>)`.

An added ADR is readable without `research.md`. Use MADR headings two levels deeper than the permanent file. Do not write Status or Date. `SUPERSEDED`, `DEPRECATED`, and `AMENDED` follow the delta vocabulary. `AMENDED` is only a typo, link, title, description, tags, or Related. Supersede a decision instead of rewriting it.

## design.md

Write Overview, Requirements Traceability, Components and Interfaces, Data Model, Error Handling, Testing Strategy, Migration, and `# Delta`. Trace every ADDED, MODIFIED, and REMOVED id to components and a test level: Unit, Integration, Contract, E2E, Performance, Security, or Manual. Use `none` for traceability when specs do not change, and then say that Testing Strategy runs the full existing test suite. Data Model, Error Handling, and Migration are `none` when unused.

Stop and return to `/sdd-req` when the design needs an interface or data change that is not in the requirements delta. Steering deltas here are only `architecture.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`, and topic files. Follow steering. When the design departs from it, change steering in the delta and add `rationale` when the ADR rule applies.

`Runs on` is Local, CI, Staging, or Human. Contract tests check the shape without the counterpart running. Performance tests measure latency, throughput, or error rate. Security tests include SAST, DAST, or vulnerability checks.

## Finish

Run stamp and check. Commit `research.md` and `design.md` together as one `docs` commit. Stage only this issue directory.
