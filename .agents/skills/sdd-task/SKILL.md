# sdd-task

Docs directory: `docs`. Write task text in `ja`. Issue directory: `docs/issues/<current-branch>/`. Stop when `design.md` is missing. Do not ask questions.

Run `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs check --scope setup` first. Read requirements, design, and steering.

## task.md

Use `# Tasks` and checkbox only the major items. A major item is one vertical slice an agent can finish in one pass, with 2 to 6 minor items, and it can pass its tests alone. Number majors in execution order. Mark independent majors with `(P)`. `Depends on:` may cite only smaller numbers.

Each minor item is implementation or a test at the design's test level, followed by `Requirements: <ids>`. Every traceability id appears on some minor item. A removed id gets a deletion item. Do not add a task for updating permanent docs.

When traceability is `none`, omit `Requirements:` and put "run the full existing test suite" on the last implementation major, before Manual verification.

This example passes `check` with the `/sdd-req` and `/sdd-design` examples. Keep its indentation and labels, and write the text in `ja`. On `task.md`, `check` verifies `Depends on:`, traceability coverage, minor counts, and that each non-manual minor has `Requirements:` (Manual verification majors stay human-only in `/sdd-impl`). Write `task.md` first, then check. Do not open `.agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs` before that check, and afterwards open it only for a report this skill does not explain.

    - Requirements: REQ-CRN-NEW-1, REQ-CRN-NEW-2
  - 1.3 Unit and integration tests for issuing
    - Requirements: REQ-CRN-NEW-1, REQ-CRN-NEW-2, DATA-CRN-NEW-1

    - Requirements: REQ-INV-2
- [ ] 4. Manual verification
  - Depends on: 2, 3
  - 4.1 Issue a credit note on the screen and check the already credited message on a second try
    - Requirements: REQ-CRN-NEW-1, REQ-CRN-NEW-2

    - Requirements: REQ-INV-1
```

## Verification

| Runs on | Where it is tracked |
|---|---|
| Local | Completion of the major item |
| Human | The final major item, `Manual verification` |
| CI | Pull request section `Post-merge verification` |
| Staging | Pull request section `Post-merge verification` |

Write the CI and Staging test code during implementation, and do not run those suites here. Human checks are only those a person can do before close. A visual check that needs a deployed environment is Staging.

## Review

Before Finish or handing off to `/sdd-impl`, reread `task.md` against this list yourself. Fix each failure. Human Manual verification and the person's `manual ok` commit stay required; do not auto-check those steps.

- Each major has 2 to 6 minor items and can pass its tests alone.
- Every traceability id appears on a minor `Requirements:` line; Manual verification is the last major when used.
- Each non-manual minor cites at least one requirement id; manual-only screen checks live under Manual verification.
- CI and Staging tests appear as minor items but are not run during `/sdd-task`.
- Task granularity matches the design test levels (automated vs Manual/Human).

Run `bun .agents/skills/sdd-scripts/sdd.mjs check --issue <feature>`, then commit only this issue directory as `docs`.
